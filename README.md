* recieve only channels (<-chan)
* example of my limiter
* example of getting on a closed channel
* returning stuff in defer (like errors)
* recovering from errors
* methods on types other than struct
* new keyword
* const map
* distinctions in defer: passing var OR using var from parent func scope
* error shadowing: named err error in func definition & redeclared err error in if statement that returns (also use defer to show true value with prints in caling func)
